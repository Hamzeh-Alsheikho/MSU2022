**I will try and update this GitHub repo as much as I can with as much info as possible, for anyone familiar with git and GitHub, please make contributions to this repo as the course progresses so we can use this as a central location for information sharing.**



**Course Explanation**

Timeline for the course embedded in the ppt

AZ-900
AZ-104 + Exam
AZ-305 + Exam

Between these course there is ALOT of crossover of material. We will be using the Microsoft slide decks and labs for these courses in addition to more material.

Each of theses courses are taught normally over 4 days each, we have much more time than this. A good portion of the time in this course will need to be self study upon behalf of the student.

These exams are not easy, and at the end of a course under normal public course conditions the recommendation is to study for a couple of weeks after the course to prep for the exam. We do not have that luxury. 

If you work hard for the next few weeks, study and read all the material set out for you, then you will have the knowledge to be able to take and pass the exams without any problems.

The case studies will also be provided for you to work upon and complete during the course, they will include some scenarios for you to build and test for you to  work upon the Azure platform.

**Timeline**

There is a file in this repo called "MSU 2022 kalender_Microsoft_Azure Cloud Platform.xlsx" this will give us a rough guide for how we are going to work through the course.

#### 9-12 August

AZ-900 is a one day Azure course, this course is designed to simply give an overview of some of the Azure services, it is normally a starting point for technical people and just enough info for non technical managers. There is an exam for the AZ-900 but we will not be doing it as the other exams we will complete will far outweigh the difficulty level of this beginner exam.

The custom content for 3 days is supposed to fill you in with some information about on-site Windows Servers and concepts, including some basic networking, Hyper-V / Virtual Machines, Active Directory, Group policy, and other on-site administration tasks your average administrator will use on a daily basis. I will add to this content as we go along and might throw in a bit of git and github for change control along with some VScode. You probably have some experience of this information already, think of this as a warm up week.

#### 15-19 August

AZ-040 is a basic powershell course for 3 days, this is the normal timeline for this course and will cover powerhsell scripting that is essential for proper Azure administration in the future, if you have already done some Python or JS the powershell will look pretty familiar to you and should be a pretty easy section. If you have not done any programming or scripting before, do not worry as this is designed to teach to sysadmins in the Windows world that have not been used to writing any code in the past. 

#### 22-26 August

#### 29 August - 2 September

#### 5-9 September

#### 12-16th September
